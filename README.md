### `Description of the project`

In this project you will find a dashboard with different react components, such as:
- Navbar
- forecast
- weather
- pollution
- app
- index

Each of these components has its own functionality and can be found in the src folder.

In the Navbar component you can find the buttons that allow us to navigate between the different sections of the dashboard (I emphasize that for practical reasons the functionality to navigate between the different sections was not implemented, but it can be easily implemented).

In the forecast component you can find a graph that shows the temperature and precipitation for the next 5 days in different cities.
In the weather component you can find a table that shows the location, temperature and weather of 5 different cities.
In the pollution component you can find a component that shows the different levels of pollution for the last 3 days in various cities.

Additionally, we created a search engine that allows us to search for a city and shows us information about it, such as temperature, humidity, pressure and wind.
